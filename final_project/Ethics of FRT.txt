#This algorithm detects all images for Keanu Reeves, Meryl Streep, and Will Ferrel in my #database (See Appendix D)
# but could not detect some of Idris Elba's images. Instead it 
# displays the error: " IndexError: list index out of range error"
# Why is this so? According to Stackoverflow
# (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59919993/indexerror-list-index-out-of-range-face-recognition)
# this algorithm displays the error: " IndexError: list index out of range error"
# because it could not detect a given image. Hence one ethics issue in facial recognition.
#Some experts claim that facial recognition technology (sometimes) misidentifies dark skinned people

# This algorithm works by using your webcam and phone to provide real-time facial recognition
# to simulate real-time facial recognition used in practice.

#Note Findings: Algorithms normally works fine but either fails to detect or name
# an unknown face if the phone being held to the Webcam is either held too far 
# away or if the phone showing the unknown face is held at an angle. Hence an ethical
# issue of misidentification of some unknown faces
