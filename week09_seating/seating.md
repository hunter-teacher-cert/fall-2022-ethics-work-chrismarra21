Airplane Seating Algorithm

A thoughtful approach to airline seating within the main cabin of the plane would be as follows:
Certain seats would be reserved for people with special needs.
Those seats would be in the front of the main cabin or in a row with slightly extra space.
Special needs could be someone in a wheelchair or some legitimate disability that makes it difficult for them to maneuver tight spaces.

With those seats blocked off, the remaining seats will be filled in by row order starting in the front and working the way back.  All persons in the party would be seated together assuming the row is large enough.  If there was not enough room in the row, because it was partially filled, they would be assigned to the next row. Any partially filled rows would be filled in with people traveling alone.
